# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This classic game is designed to be played by two players, alternating turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Allows two players to compete against each other.
- **Responsive design**: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Visually appealing and easy-to-use interface.
- **Real-time game status**: Displays whose turn it is and the winner when the game ends.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move.
2. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
3. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
5. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
